# MercadoLivre WMS Front End Test

In this test we will build an item review area.

It will contain two pages:

- Login page
- Item review page

<hr />
<br />

üñ•Ô∏è **Login page**

Implement a login page with a form to login, it doesn't have to actually log you in or do any checks, but things like e-mail validation are appreciated!

üñ•Ô∏è **Item overview page**

This will show some items that will be populated by the [Meli API](https://developers.mercadolivre.com.br/pt_br/api-docs-pt-br).

The following should be true for this page:

- All the items will be displayed here
- Should have a search bar to [find specific items](https://api.mercadolibre.com/sites/MLA/search?q=‚Äã:query)
- The item have to be shown with the data in a user-friendly way
- Each item can be favorited or unfavorited
- Each item can be rated
- Should have a sidebar showing [all the categories](https://api.mercadolibre.com/sites/MLB/categories)

<br />

üî¥ **Important**

- Building a back-end to this test is optional.
- You can use _any framework/library to build the front-end_

üñäÔ∏è **Evaluation Criteria**

- The app must run.
- You must open a pull request
- Your app is lean and mean (small files that make the page look good).
- You implemented a proper grid.
- Your app is responsive.
- Your app is well structured.
- You implemented the rating functionality without using a third-party library.

<br />

üéÅ **Bonus points**

- You wrote unit tests.
- You wrote server side code instead of using a utility application like http-server.
- You implement actual endpoints to request the item data.
- You implemented actual authentication
- Good luck, and have fun! üéâ
