<center><h1>MercadoLivre WMS Front End Test</h1></center>

In this test we will build an item review area.

It will contain two pages:

- Login page
- Item review page

<hr />
<br />

🖥️ **Login page**

Implement a login page with a form to login, it doesn't have to actually log you in or do any checks, but things like e-mail validation are appreciated!


🖥️ **Item overview page**

This will show some items that will be populated by the [Meli API](https://developers.mercadolivre.com.br/pt_br/api-docs-pt-br).

The following should be true for this page:

- All the items will be displayed here
- Should have a search bar to [find specific items](https://api.mercadolibre.com/sites/MLA/search?q=​:query)
- The item have to be shown with the data in a user-friendly way
- Each item can be favorited or unfavorited
- Each item can be rated
- Should have a sidebar showing [all the categories](https://api.mercadolibre.com/sites/MLB/categories)
